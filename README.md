# Computer-Networks-I
This repository contains the projects from the Computer Networks I course at Colorado School of Mines taken in Fall 2021. The README in each folder contains the project requirements and other necessary information.

Welcome to Computer Networks I:
This introduction to computer networks covers the fundamentals of computer communications.
While the Application and Physical layers will be covered the course will focus on the Transport,
Network and Link Layers. There will be a heavy emphasis on the practical application of topics
covered with homework assignments in network programing and traffic analysis.

Learning Objectives:
After successfully completing this course, you will be able to:
• Analyze 1 the organization and structure of modern network designs.
• Demonstrate knowledge of the details of a modern TCP/IP/Ethernet environment.
• Provided with minimal contextual information develop conclusions regarding what a given
packet on the network should look like (without looking at the packet),
• Shown a packet that does not conform to standards describe what is wrong
• Predict how the network will react to any given packet.
• Describe the structure and governance model of the modern Internet.
• Operate common network diagnostic tools.
• Use network (socket) programing to develop solutions to real-world network related challenges.
